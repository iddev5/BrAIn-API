   .. rubric:: BrAIn API Documentation
      :name: brain-api-documentation

   **Heya, welcome to the documentation of my API, which is called the
   BrAIn API**

   | This API is made to connect, which means that everything in this
     API is globally connected to every client you wish to make. This
     API is not finished but I will be updating this documentation every
     update I make to the `GitHub
     repo <https://github.com/LucAngevare/API>`__ and I will also be
     making a change log here. Check out the list of what I'm planning
     to add over at the `Trello
     board <https://trello.com/b/rtyhPHep>`__!

   .. rubric:: BrAIn, what's the story behind the name?
      :name: brain-what-s-the-story-behind-the-name-

   It may not seem like it but BrAIn has a bit of a history. I had this
   subject at school that was called W&T (science and mechanics
   basically) where we had to do research, make research papers and make
   stuff. We had this subject for 3 years and at the end of this subject
   we had to take on a bit of a bigger project, it didn't matter if we
   finished it or not as long as your dreams were big enough and your
   documentation and logs were good enough.

   Back then I was absolutely obsessed with assistants even though I was
   just starting out with programming.

   That was when I (with 2 other people) came up with the idea to make
   an assistant, it would look like the Google Home but with a glass
   case so you could see the hardware and it would cool better. We would
   use a Raspberry Pi (model B, it was some time ago) for the hardware
   and program it in Python because that was the only programming
   language I had experience in. I would be in charge of programming it
   (I had chosen the name before I knew this project would even be a
   thing), a friend of mine would take care of making the case (which
   was probably the hardest job, he had to try and make glass round) and
   the last person would be in charge of the hardware. In conclusion,
   everything failed, we switched to clear plastic instead of glass for
   the case, the program had failed completely and the API I made for
   the Speech to Text had gone down just a few days before, the speaker
   was way too soft and the microphone had been wrongly soldered. We got
   a B though so I mean it wasn't all too bad.

   | I could have chosen another name for this but honestly this name
     just brings back so many memories and it's not a bad name so I
     think I'm gonna keep it, and it kind of feels like I'm finishing an
     old project in my friends' names so it's too good to not
     re-purpose.

   .. rubric:: Who is this for?
      :name: who-is-this-for-

   | This project is for anyone who wants to make their own IoT smart
     home but wants to make their own clients, this API is made to
     connect systems so anyone who is advanced enough to program their
     own client (or piggy-back on pre-made clients that I made) can use
     this.

   .. rubric:: Prerequisites
      :name: prerequisites

   -  You need to have a version of NodeJS with NPM installed on your
      machine (this might not be necessary if I release an executable)
   -  You need to have `these modules <>`__ installed, you can install
      these by going to the root of the directory with the command line
      and running ``npm install`` there.

   | 

   .. rubric:: Usage
      :name: usage

   | The API is fairly easy to use, if you have the modules installed,
     it's just a matter of going to the root of the directory with the
     command line and running ``npm start`` there.

   .. rubric:: Issues
      :name: issues

   I'm somewhat new to development still (been programming since the end
   of 2016), so bugs are not that surprising, I've also used some new,
   bodgey techniques here although hidden behind some beautiful scripts
   ðŸ˜Š

   | When filing for an issue, please include the API version, OS
     details and what I could do to reproduce this issue so I can fix
     this ASAP!

   .. rubric:: Want to contribute?
      :name: want-to-contribute-

   I would absolutely love it if you were to contribute to my API, the
   more help I can get on this the better it'll become and the more I
   can learn from others.

   | Bug reports and pull requests are absolutely welcome on `my GitHub
     repo <https://github.com/LucAngevare/API>`__. This project is
     intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, which is
     why I would love it if you made issues and/or pull requests,
     however, contributors still are expected to adhere to the
     `Contributor Covenant <http://contributor-covenant.org>`__ code of
     conduct.

   .. rubric:: What if I want to help but can't contribute?
      :name: what-if-i-want-to-help-but-can-t-contribute-

   There's more than enough ways you can help! For example:

   -  Something broken? File an issue! Bonus points if you try to fix
      it. It helps if you include the API version, OS details and what I
      could do to reproduce this issue!
   -  Good at breaking something? Look through `the list of things that
      need
      testing <https://github.com/LucAngevare/API/blob/master/READMEs/testMe.md>`__
      and do your absolute best to completely wreak my work (please file
      an issue after though :P)
   -  Look through `open
      issues <https://github.com/LucAngevare/API/issues?state=open>`__
      and see if there's a topic or application you happen to have
      experience with!
   -  Got any ideas for what to add to this? Shoot me a DM on `my
      Discord <https://discord.com/users/478903410159255572>`__ and I'll
      add it to the `Trello board <https://trello.com/b/rtyhPHep>`__
